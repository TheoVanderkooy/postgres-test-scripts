TODO
====

- [x] create the databases with whatever sizes -- one for each block size and scale factor, but NOT for each branch
- [x] load data with benchbases
- [x] indexes: can drop and re-create them hopefully? (what about primary keys?)
- [ ] clustering:
    - [x] allow specifying how to cluster
    - [ ] revisit: is it better to simply cluster every time?
- [ ] database configuration files!
- [ ] benchbase configuration files!
